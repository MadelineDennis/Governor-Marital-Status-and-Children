# Governor-Marital-Status-and-Children
This is my replication package for my social statistics course where I analyzed U.S state governors from the year 2000 to present. I analyzed whether or not each governor is married and how many kids each governor has. My goal was to determine whether or not a governor's marital status impacts the number of children they have.
